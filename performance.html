                    <h2>The new Seven® 620 R is the fastest road car we've ever made. It's not for the faint-hearted...</h2>
                    <p> The new Caterham Seven® 620 R features a wide range of performance enhancements that will see it surpass the R500's legendary status... and then some. 
                        By harnessing the Carbon Fibre trickery of the Caterham F1 Team and the technical prowess, sheer desire, experience and all round know-how of our crack 
                        team of engineers we've created a monster. A very special monster.
                    <br><br>
                        Lurking at the heart of the car is the same 2.0 litre engine as found in the R500. Except we Supercharged it. That's right, we have done the automotive 
                        equivalent of attaching a rocket to a missile. We've taken something really fast and made it really fast. Delivering a mighty 310 bhp and a huge amount of torque, 
                        the 620 R is equipped with the sort of performance that is very hard to explain within the constraints of the English language or the laws of physics.
                    <br><br>
                        Furthermore, the car has been developed and honed to not only be capable of withstanding the power, but to harness it. With a entirely new sequential gearbox 
                        and uprated drive train coupled to newly developed suspension components courtesy of the Caterham F1 team the 620 R delivers more feel and handles better than 
                        anything we've ever built. We're rather proud of it. All this is coupled with weight saving measures and ergonomical improvements wherever possible, which has 
                        delivered a car that is truely at the top of its game. Hold on tight...
                    <br><br>
                        The Seven® 620 R is available as a factory built car only, hand-built by our skilled team in England and it'll be shipped as a rolling chassis. The engine and 
                        gearbox are not included in the base price and are available as a separate package, which can then be fitted by a third party that will be recommended to you by 
                        your local dealer.

                    <p> <strong>#1: It’s rare</strong>
                        <br>
                        The Seven is an ideal car for the collector willing to delve deep into arcane build options and figure out which cars hold 
                        their value best. Between its introduction in 1957 and end of production in 1972, about 2,500 Super Sevens were made.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>#2: It (can be) period-correct</strong>
                        <br>
                        While there are many advantages to simply building your own Seven from a brand-new kit—for one, it’s cheaper; two, the car will be faster—there’s a certain satisfaction 
                        found in keeping an original Seven original. This is what cut-rate automotive enthusiasm was like in the 1950s and 1960s: no trappings, all experience.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>#3: It’s pure</strong>
                        <br>
                        The difference between a modern car and a Lotus Seven is like that between traveling on an airliner or a hang glider. There’s so little between you and the experience 
                        of driving—it’s not unlike riding a motorcycle without a helmet. There’s no power-assist anything, no insulating effect, scant bodywork. This simplicity bodes well for
                        repairs and maintenance: there are fewer things to go wrong and paper-think bodywork can conceal few mysteries.
                         <br><br>
                        <strong>#4: It’s completely thrilling</strong>
                        <br>
                        There’s not much space in here, and certainly no room for anything other than the purest experience of driving. Stir up the four-pot Ford with the four-speed manual 
                        transmission and a lovely warble comes fizzing and parpling out the side-exhaust. The wind snatches at your hat, the steering wheel comes alive under your fingertips, 
                        it’s an instant dart of the right foot for a rev-matched downshift, and corners are easily dispatched with more speed than you thought possible.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>#5: It’s a little bit dangerous</strong>
                        <br>
                        In a modern world where the corners have been sanded off of everything and our cars are practically hollowed-out Nerf balls with heated seats, the Seven has a frisson
                        of risk about it. Again, it’s like a motorcycle, with gossamer bodywork that provides about as much protection as a light jacket. Without romanticizing the danger
                        overmuch, driving around in a Seven feels daring at speeds which the constabulary won’t find offensive. You never fail to unfold yourself from its cockpit without 
                        a raised pulse, and every trip becomes an event. Even in the classic car world, few can match the real-world fun it offers.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>#6: It can go the distance</strong>
                        <br>
                        Assuming the driver is possessed of sound constitution and a good set of woollen underwear, the Seven is not incapable of a solid road trip. Because it’s so simple, 
                        keeping it on the road isn’t the hair-tearing struggle it can be with more high-strung machinery, and if you forgo a passenger, a duffel bag fits just fine to your 
                        right. The main car featured in this article is driven year-round, rain or shine, and regularly participates in local multi-day cruise events.
