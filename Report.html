                            <i>Peter Graham Ferreira</i><br><br>
                            
                            
                            <br><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
                            I am a Lotus 7 enthusiast and therefore decided to create a magazine style Lotus 7 website for my fellow Lotus 7 followers. 
                            I am part of a few Lotus 7 groups that share different information about technical data, the next Lotus runs and racing events as well as current information such as how their Lotus 7 build is going etc.
                            This platform gave me enough information to build a Lotus 7 ‘magazine style’ website that can grow and develop over time, sharing all relevant information for the viewer to access under one site.
                            
                            <br><br><strong>INSPIRATION</strong><br>
                            •	I have spent the last five years building my Lotus 7 and therefore this was an automatic inspiration to now develop a website using this as a subject.<br>
                            •	The flow of the website was a progression of how I adapted my time and expertise in the production and discipline of building my car. One always starts with the end in mind.<br>
                            •	As I am a keen racer myself, having raced go-karts at Killarney in Cape Town, the Lotus 7 clearly would be the dream vehicle to race.  My interest has stemmed from classic cars to all current beautiful cars.<br>
                            
                            <br><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong><br>
                            •	People with disabilities won’t be hampered as I built this site having total responsive design in mind. Users can zoom in on the page without it affecting the overall layout and formatting.<br>
                            •	Navigation is user friendly, clear and concise with large buttons.<br>
                            •	All images have alt tags for screen-reader purposes.<br>
                            
                            
                            <br><strong>USABILITY</strong><br>
                            •	Again clear and concise images and copy have been represented and relevant.<br>
                            •	I ensured that all the information was relevant and up to date.<br>
                            •	As I have hands on understanding with the Lotus 7 – the information is correct and the viewer will know that he/she can reply on this source.<br>
                            
                            <br><strong>LEARNING</strong><br>
                            •	In order to have created a dynamic navigation bar for mobile viewing I needed to research how to do this using w3schools as a resource.<br>
                            •	I learnt how to create the dynamic nav bar using Java script, CSS and HTML.<br>
                            •	I changed and edited the code to work with my site and is referenced in my code.<br>
                            •	I used bootstrap to create a responsive display and also created override classes and IDs where I wanted to change bootstap’s default functionality.<br>
                            
                            <br><strong>WHAT WORKED WELL</strong><br>
                            •	Bootstrap made it simple for me to create a fully responsive design  without having to write much CSS code.<br>
                            •	All the images worked well complimenting one another.<br>
                            •	The simplicity of the site kept the viewer intrigued, not feeling overwhelmed and hopefully educated them and answering their questions.<br>
                            
                            <br><strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong><br>
                            If I had had more time, I would have made the website feel even more engaging.<br>
                            I would have perhaps had more videos with the build in progress.<br>
                            
                            <br><strong>RESOURCES</strong><br>
                            •	W3schools<br>
                            •	All media has been referenced in the comments in the code.<br>
